# Game Whack a Mole

It's my first game project combining HTML, Sass, BEM, Css, Javascript all together.
How to play this game:

1. Press the start button and the game will start.
2. When a mole appears whack it with a hammer.
3. The game length is 30 seconds and you need to whack as many moles as possible in a given time.
4. After the game is finished, to start a new game press the start button again.
5. Good luck. ðŸ˜‰
